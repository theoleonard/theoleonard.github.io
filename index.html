      <p>This year in Computers I learned how to make an other image look like it was on a different image. What kind of software I used was GIMP. How I would do it is I would take a differnt image of the internet then take another image and put them together to make a differnet image form the both of them. Then we did HTML coding what kind of software I used Notepad++ and Brackets. When I made my first webpage I was proud of myself when it started to work. The next unit was 3D Modeling/Unreal 4 Unit I learned how to make a Snowman, coffee cup that was in the blender unit. When we moved on to the Unreal 4 Unit I learned how to make a model and how to scale it, and make a texture on a object, adding my own textures that I made, and lastly how to make a Martian Biosphere. The next unit was CS Unpluged I learned how a computer helps you get to your location faster, and how to make a game/robot work. The second to last Unit was the Hardware unit in this unit I learend how to make 3D computer parts and how a computer works. The last Unit is JavaScript what I did in this Unit was make a working text box that will appear when you open the webpage. Also how to make a button that will bring up a nother message and how to make a animated banner and lastly make the first step to a passcode. </p>
